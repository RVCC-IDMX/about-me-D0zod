## Project Description
The purpose of this project was to slowly learn and improve my skills at building a website using HTML5 and CSS in a college course. I learned a variety of things in the 14 weeks we had, such as:

  * Setting up and navigating VSCode.

  * Understanding the languages I'd be using throughout the course, HTML5 and CSS.

  * Familiarizing myself with HMTL and creating small projects to bolster my knowledge.

  * Learning about and setting up a GitHub account, learning to create repositories and how they work, what CPR is, and how to properly format my code for legibility. 

  * Creating a netlify account and linking it to this repository to have a fully built and online site that I can continue to tweak and learn with.

  * Learning the ways in which I can format text, images, elements, and more to make the website look the way I want it to using CSS.

  * Learning how to properly code my website to be responsive and as accessible as possible to a variety of devices as well as disabilities.

  * Creating a new mini project site to further challenge my knowledge of HTML and CSS

  * How to embed videos, photos, and music into my site using a handful of methods.

  * How to build, design, and organize tables and forms for my website for people to read data or fill out. 

  * Creating a navigation bar for my website.
